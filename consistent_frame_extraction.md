Great question ‚Äî understanding how MP4 video encoding works is crucial when you‚Äôre using ffmpeg to extract frames, especially at different FPS rates. The core issue here is that MP4 is not just a collection of frames ‚Äî it‚Äôs a compressed video format that uses inter-frame compression, meaning not every frame is fully self-contained. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what‚Äôs happening under the hood and what it means for frame extraction:

üß† MP4 Encoding: The Basics

MP4 is a container format ‚Äî it can hold video, audio, subtitles, and metadata. For video, it typically uses a codec like H.264 (AVC) to encode the video stream.

1. Compression Strategy

H.264 compresses video by breaking it into Groups of Pictures (GOPs) made up of three types of frames:

Frame Type	Name	Description
I-frame	Intra-coded	Full image (keyframe)
P-frame	Predicted	Encodes changes from a previous I- or P-frame
B-frame	Bi-directional	Encodes changes from both past and future frames

‚úÖ Only I-frames are fully self-contained. P- and B-frames depend on other frames to be decoded correctly.

üîç Why This Matters for Frame Extraction

When you extract frames from an MP4 using ffmpeg, the tool has to decode frames in sequence, especially when it needs to extract non-I-frames. This introduces two key implications:

A. Seeking Can Be Imprecise

If you try to jump to timestamp t=10s and extract a frame, ffmpeg might actually seek to the nearest previous I-frame, then decode forward from there to get the exact frame you requested.
	‚Ä¢	This is why frame-accurate extraction can be slow or off by a few frames unless you decode sequentially or re-encode with all I-frames (see below).

B. Extracting at Different FPS Rates May Not Align

If you extract:
	‚Ä¢	One version at 5 FPS, and
	‚Ä¢	Another version at 10 FPS,

They might not align exactly frame-to-frame, unless you:
	1.	Decode from the same I-frame boundaries,
	2.	Use deterministic decoding, or
	3.	Re-encode to an I-frame-only version.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Get Consistent Frame Extraction with ffmpeg

‚úÖ Option 1: Re-encode to I-frame-only video

ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -g 1 -keyint_min 1 -sc_threshold 0 -x264opts "keyint=1:min-keyint=1:no-scenecut" -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 18 i_frames_only.mp4

	‚Ä¢	This forces every frame to be an I-frame.
	‚Ä¢	Frame extraction will now be deterministic and perfectly aligned across FPS variants.

‚úÖ Option 2: Decode Entire Video and Then Extract

If you can afford the storage and time:

ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vsync 0 frame_%05d.png

	‚Ä¢	This decodes the full stream into raw frames (preserving temporal accuracy).

Then, to extract specific FPS variants, you can do a second pass on the extracted images.

üß™ Example Use Case

Say you have a dashcam video and want to extract:
	‚Ä¢	30 FPS full video
	‚Ä¢	5 FPS clip focusing on an event

To keep annotations consistent:
	‚Ä¢	Re-encode to all I-frames first
	‚Ä¢	Or decode the full stream and post-process downsampled frame sequences

This ensures that frame X at 5 FPS and frame 6*X at 30 FPS are actually the same visual moment, and not off due to B/P-frame interpolation artifacts.

üìù Summary

Concept	Explanation
MP4 is compressed	Not all frames are full images; uses inter-frame compression
I-frames are key	Only I-frames are fully decodable without context
Random access = complex	Seeking requires decoding from the last I-frame
Frame alignment needs care	Different FPS extraction rates can desync without preprocessing
Solution	Re-encode to I-frame-only or decode the full video first
