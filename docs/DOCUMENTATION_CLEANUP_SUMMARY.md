# Documentation Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Successfully organized all design and summary markdown documents from the root directory into a logical, navigable documentation structure.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Created Documentation Structure
```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                    # Documentation index and navigation guide
â”œâ”€â”€ features/                    # Feature documentation and user guides
â”œâ”€â”€ implementation/              # Technical implementation details and fixes
â”œâ”€â”€ testing/                     # Testing procedures and validation guides
â””â”€â”€ design/                      # Design specifications and architectural decisions
```

### 2. Moved Files by Category

#### Features (3 files)
- `TIMESTAMP_EXTRACTION_README.md` â†’ `docs/features/`
- `LARGE_FRAME_SCROLLER_SUMMARY.md` â†’ `docs/features/`
- `MINIMIZE_FUNCTIONALITY_SUMMARY.md` â†’ `docs/features/`

#### Implementation (7 files)
- `FRAME_ALIGNMENT_FIX_SUMMARY.md` â†’ `docs/implementation/`
- `FRAME_DISPLAY_FIX_SUMMARY.md` â†’ `docs/implementation/`
- `ANNOTATION_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` â†’ `docs/implementation/`
- `FPS_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` â†’ `docs/implementation/`
- `IFRAME_INTEGRATION_README.md` â†’ `docs/implementation/`
- `REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md` â†’ `docs/implementation/`
- `IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` â†’ `docs/implementation/`

#### Testing (1 file)
- `FRAME_EXTRACTION_TEST_README.md` â†’ `docs/testing/`

#### Design (3 files)
- `consistent_frame_extraction.md` â†’ `docs/design/`
- `extracting_frame_timestamps.md` â†’ `docs/design/`
- `PHASE2.md` â†’ `docs/design/`

### 3. Created Navigation Infrastructure

#### Documentation Index (`docs/README.md`)
- Comprehensive overview of all documentation
- Categorized file listings with descriptions
- Quick start guide for different user types
- Key achievements summary
- Contributing guidelines

#### Main README Update
- Added documentation section with links to organized docs
- Quick links to most important documentation
- Clear navigation path for users

## Benefits

### ðŸŽ¯ Improved Organization
- Logical categorization by purpose (features, implementation, testing, design)
- Clear separation of user-facing vs. technical documentation
- Easy navigation through structured directories

### ðŸ“š Enhanced Discoverability
- Comprehensive documentation index with descriptions
- Quick links to key documents
- Clear categorization helps users find relevant information

### ðŸ”§ Better Maintenance
- Organized structure makes it easier to add new documentation
- Clear guidelines for where different types of docs belong
- Reduced clutter in root directory

### ðŸ‘¥ Improved Developer Experience
- New contributors can easily find relevant documentation
- Technical vs. user documentation clearly separated
- Testing and design docs easily accessible

## File Count Summary
- **Total files moved**: 14 markdown files
- **Root directory cleaned**: All design/summary docs removed from root
- **New structure created**: 4 organized directories + navigation
- **Documentation preserved**: All content maintained, just reorganized

## Next Steps
1. Update any internal links in moved documents if needed
2. Consider adding more specific documentation as features are developed
3. Maintain the organization structure for future documentation

## Impact
The root directory is now much cleaner with only essential files (README.md, application code, configuration) while all documentation is properly organized and easily discoverable through the new `docs/` structure.
